# Disease-Classification-Model
Created a model using correlation matrix, feature engineering techniques for the prediction.

Perform exhaustive EDA for numeric and categorical data.
Print visual results for cardio vascular/ heart problems faced by
males and females and check how closely / or not are they related.

Using correlation matrix check what features/ symptoms are related to each other.

Use feature engineering techniques / feature reduction techniques to reduce the size of the data for efficient modelling.
